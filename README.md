The friendlyName is given to your device on Mystrom site.
If not sure about the friendlyNames of your devices, take a look in your openhab.log. The discovered devices are listed.

Examples, how to configure your items in your items file, you can configure as Switch, Number or String, 
String is usefull for scripting because you can receive the state on, off or offline:

    Switch WallFanOffice_Switch 	{mystromecopower="lightBathroom"}
    Number WallFanOffice_Number 	{mystromecopower="lightBathroom"}
    String WallFanOffice_String 	{mystromecopower="lightBathroom"}					

*Switch: used to get state on/off of the device, accepted commands are <b>on</b>,<b>off</b>. For master device supports <b>restart</b> command to restart the master.
